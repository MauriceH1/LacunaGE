This is an educational project! <br />
<br />
My goal is to have a functional game engine that supports DX12, Vulkan, Is crossplatform, has a multithreaded entity component system, has physics handled my Bullet or PhysX and audio through WWise.<br />
I'm looking to implement clustered forward rendering, possibly a raytracer and if time permits I will develop a clone of this engine using my univisity's facilities to port the engine to PS4 as well.<br />
<br />
suggestions, questions and feedback are welcome.
